Oh, Santiana gained the day
Away Santiana
Now pull the yan up the west they say
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave her up and away we'll go
Away Santiana
Heave her up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

She's a fast clipper ship and a bully good crew
Away Santiana
And an old salty Yank for a captain too
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave her up and away we'll go
Away Santiana
Heave her up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

Santiana fought for gold
Away Santiana
Around Cape Horn through the ice and snow
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave her up and away we'll go
Away Santiana
Heave her up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

'Twas on the field of Molly-Del-Rey
Away Santiana
Well, both his legs got blown away
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave her up and away we'll go
Away Santiana
Heave her up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

It was a fierce and bitter strife
Away Santiana
The general Taylor took his life
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave her up and away we'll go
Away Santiana
Heave her up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

Santiana, now we mourn
Away Santiana
We left him buried off Cape Horn
Along the plains of Mexico
