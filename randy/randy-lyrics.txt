VERS 1
Now we are ready to head for the Horn
Way, hay, roll an' go
Our boots an' our clothes boys are all in the pawn
To be rollicking randy dandy-O

CHORUS
Heave a pawl, o heave away
Way, hay, roll an' go
The anchor's on board an' the cable's all stored
To be rollicking randy dandy-O

VERS 2
Man the stout caps'n an' heave with a will
Way, hay, roll an' go
Soon we'll be drivin' her 'way down the hill
To be rollicking randy dandy-O

CHORUS

VERS 3
Soon we'll be warping her out through the locks
Way, hay, roll an' go
Where the pretty young gals all come down in their flocks
To be rollicking randy dandy-O

CHORUS

VERS 4
We're outward bound for Vallipo Bay
Way, hay, roll an' go
Get crackin', m' lads, 'tis a hell o' a way
To be rollicking randy dandy-O

CHORUS * 2
