In 1812 in the month of May (I wish I was in Sherbrooke now)
When a letter of Marque came from the king
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen (God damn them all)

"Ah well" says Barrett through the town (I wish I was...)
"I need 20 good men, all fishermen who
Would make for me the Antelope's crew" (God damn them all)

I've been told
We sail the seas for American gold
We fire no guns
Shed no tears
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's privateers

On the king's birthday we put to sea (I wish I was...)
With 91 days to Montego bay
Pumping like a madman all the way (God damn them all)

And Barrett worked us to the bone (I wish I was...)
With maggoty meat and weadmully bread
And watery rum we'd be better of dead (God damn them all)

I've been told...

On christmas eve in the afternoon (I wish I was...)
An american slupe came into view
And Barrett cries to her: "heave to" (God damn them all)

He came alongside to get onboard (I wish I was...)
Then the yankee ship opened up broadside
And I lost one leg and most of my eye (God damn them all)

I've been told...

And when they brought me home from sea (I wish I was...)
No work for one-legged Jack they say
And I curse Barrett 'til my dying day (God damn them all)

I've been told...
